My name is Jeremiah Billmann and I'm a Senior Software Engineer with [Skyline Technologies](http://www.skylinetechnologies.com/) - a world-class IT consulting company.  I've been in software consulting for much of the past decade taking on roles ranging from developer to software development manager.

I have a tremendous amount of passion for software design patterns, best practices and web applications. I feel most at home in the world of full stack web development with HTML and JavaScript, but I've worked with so many different languages, frameworks and technologies that sometimes I forget how old I am.

I am the founder and creator of [Feature Ops](https://www.featureops.com) - formely a Feature Flags service (more to come soon).  I am also the author of all of the [Feature Ops SDKs](https://github.com/featureops).

I helped the [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) blogging platform [get up](https://www.jbillmann.com/installing-ghost-on-azure-web-sites/) and [running on Azure](https://www.jbillmann.com/installing-ghost-from-the-azure-web-site-gallery/).

When I'm not coding, I have a conflict of interests as I hold a personal trainer certification and I appreciate well crafted beer.

Speaking of beer, I helped lead development for [Beerology](http://www.bestwindows8apps.net/app/beerology/).

I like to build and tinker with stuff.  I am the author of a simple, multiplayer game server (and client), called [GarageServer.IO](https://github.com/jbillmann/GarageServer.IO) for Node.js.  I also wrote [MicroSliver](https://github.com/jbillmann/microsliver) and all of its [extensions](https://github.com/jbillmann/SignalR.MicroSliver).

Rumor has it that I once rewrote the core game engine of [Rampage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rampage_(arcade_game)) using just HTML5 & JavaScript... and added multiplayer online using [SignalR](https://github.com/SignalR/SignalR).

I speak for myself on this blog.  If you do not like the content on this blog, I'm told that vanilla ice cream usually does the trick.

I enjoy speaking in front of people about my many passions.  If you have interest in me speaking, please reach out to me.

I find most things in life funny, but roofing a house is serious business.

Anyways, nice to meet you, I hope you enjoy my blog.

-Jeremiah
